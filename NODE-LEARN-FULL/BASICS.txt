ECMAScript -> standard format to package JS package for reuse

***********IN FILE 1 WE EXPORT (one function or more )****************
function addTwo(num) {
    return num+10;
}
export { addTwo };

****************IN OTHER FILE WE IMPORT FUNCTION IN ECMAScript way*********************
import { addTwo } from './folder/filename';


.mjs is used for ECMAScript files , in such file require('./file) doesn't works.
also for ECMAScript we need to put in package.json file
"type": "module"
